## About The Project

I created a simple React application to help user to decide which BVG Ticket to buy. Project developed without using any state management tools like Redux or MobX.
It involves one main page which includes a header and questionnaire. Questionnaire developed using [Survey JS](https://surveyjs.io/) library.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
